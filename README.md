# AntiPop-For-Chromebooks
This application is intended for any computer that have "popping" sounds when they start playing audio. It is intended for chromebooks and provides a temporary solution for them. All this application does is play white noise at a very quiet volume

Note: This application is still in the works and will likely go though a lot of visual changes, but it should work as intended
